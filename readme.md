Starting odin recipes project 2/1/20222

This project demonstrates the use of headings, lists, images, and links. The requirement was to create a homepage that links to three different recipes. Each recipe page contains an image, description, ingredients, steps, and links to sources.

This is my first HTML project from The Odin Project foundations course.
